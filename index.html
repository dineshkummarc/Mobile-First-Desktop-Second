		<p>Our <code>desktop.css</code> stylesheet uses the media query <code>screen and (min-device-width:768px)</code>.</p>
		<p><code>min-device-width</code> tells us the available space of the device, while queries such as <code>width</code> (or <code>min/max-width</code>) tell us the width of the content.</p>

		<p>Something to be aware of (as noted by <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/combining_meta.html">QuirksMode</a>):</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Some mobile browsers, notably Safari iPhone, have a default layout viewport of around 850 to 1000 pixels — much larger than the device width. (Why? In order to accomodate desktop sites whose developers did not test on mobile. Such sites usually stretch to roughly that width.)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So the default ('mobile.css') stylesheet is the one you see on the mobile device, and devices with larger viewports get the extras. The reason we set 768px for the minimum device width was mainly to accommodate the iPad and any similar tablets that appear in future. We decided that iPad users should get the full site experience, and as the iPad’s shorter screen side has a width of 768px, that's the figure we chose. Any device with a lower resolution gets the mobile version.</p>

		<p>We could use <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a> to provide media query support to IE6-8 but that only works when your media queries are using <code>min/max-width</code> and so doesn't work with <code>min/max-device-width</code>.</p>
