#Mobile First, Desktop Second

##Description

This is just a basic example of how to get started with a 'mobile first' approach.

We target:

* mobile
* tablet
* desktop

It includes a fix for the iOS orientation bug that affects iOS versions up to 5.0

Also includes a super basic example of writing JavaScript to target specific devices.

---

###TODO

* Write an example script which loads relevant low/high-res images dependant on the device
* Wrap the JavaScript into modules and incorporate [almond.js](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) (instead of RequireJs)
