#Mobile First, Desktop Second

##Description

This project is an example of a 'mobile first' approach to creating a website that works across all devices but only loads assets for the specific device needed.

###TODO

* Write an example JavaScript file which loads images dependant on the device
* Wrap the JavaScript into modules and incorporate [almond.js](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) (instead of RequireJs)
* Incorporate a responsive design using OOCSS (+Sass)

The basics are here to demonstrate the principle of "mobile first" but I would like to expand this a bit more so it can become a more realistic and useful example.
